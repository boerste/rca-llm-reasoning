Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node.

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"120614c2-bf78-4f23-82d3-03845a25077d\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:42:51.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:42:51.000: `Background saving started by pid 1569`\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:42:51.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:42:51.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"dedd77ec-a19a-4e43-8383-54decb460f24\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 09:12:01.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:12:01.000: `Background saving started by pid 1573`\\n  - 2022-03-20 09:12:01.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:12:01.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a53e136a-110a-44c5-bf79-0c1db2b17f72\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 09:58:17.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:58:17.000: `Background saving started by pid 1581` >>> 10:03:19.000: `Background saving started by pid 1582`\\n  - 2022-03-20 09:58:17.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:58:17.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"edea275a-d3bb-4214-a63f-be50709e5990\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 10:28:29.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:28:29.000: `Background saving started by pid 1587` >>> 10:33:31.000: `Background saving started by pid 1588`\\n  - 2022-03-20 10:28:29.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:28:29.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f40d562b-b74e-493b-bffd-0ca867ec9f8f\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 10:53:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:53:39.000: `Background saving started by pid 1592` >>> 10:58:41.000: `Background saving started by pid 1593`\\n  - 2022-03-20 10:53:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:53:39.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"11f4a886-eb4c-4b56-884f-ff9eb8fbbea1\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- recommendationservice-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f89fde39-f93a-4548-a687-bfda988ef617\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 12:09:09.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:09:09.000: `Background saving started by pid 1607`\\n  - 2022-03-20 12:09:09.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:09:09.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a55b23ea-4b0a-40db-841c-696308356c77\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 12:14:11.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:14:11.000: `Background saving started by pid 1608` >>> 12:19:13.000: `Background saving started by pid 1609`\\n  - 2022-03-20 12:14:11.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:14:11.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"20589a52-8daf-4bbc-9c31-5346fd7fcb5c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 13:44:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 13:44:47.000: `Background saving started by pid 1626`\\n  - 2022-03-20 13:44:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 13:44:47.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately.

A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7c48cab4-e1fb-461b-9f9b-421e0bc6b261\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:14:59.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:14:59.000: `Background saving started by pid 1632` >>> 14:20:01.000: `Background saving started by pid 1633`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:14:59.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:14:59.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7b4fb20a-f089-42e2-bf23-c641b32fc902\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- cartservice-1:\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:51.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:51.000: `ut of memory.`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:53.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:53.000: `rying to start a grpc server at  0.0.0.0:7070`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:53.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:53.000: `eading cart service port from PORT environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:53.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:53.000: `nsecure mode!`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:53.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:53.000: `eading host address from LISTEN_ADDR environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:53.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:53.000: `tarted as process with id 1`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:54.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:54.000: `     Content root path: /app`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:54.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | `[40m\\u001b[32minfo\\u001b[39m\\u001b[22m\\u001b[49m: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]` (occurred 4 times from 14:23:54.000 to 14:23:54.000 approx every 0.000s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:54.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:54.000: `     Hosting environment: Production`\\n  - 2022-03-20 14:23:54.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 14:23:54.000: `     Application started.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"afa0da77-bbe7-49ed-a3f2-05e687a92690\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 15:30:29.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 15:30:29.000: `Background saving started by pid 1647` >>> 15:35:31.000: `Background saving started by pid 1648`\\n  - 2022-03-20 15:30:29.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 15:30:29.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"ab1908d7-94ec-4a55-bc23-29c1b9da2aba\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a499aa86-396c-42ba-bb86-81c71e5dcdcb\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:17:04.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:17:04.000: `Background saving started by pid 1667`\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:17:04.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:17:04.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e61fe62f-f1c3-4df6-aa5f-7995e9ff1325\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:27:32.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:27:32.000: `Background saving started by pid 1669`\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:27:32.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:27:32.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\": \"1749e3ce-33c7-4254-aed5-27b030989608\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"AIMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"\", \"response_metadata\": {\"model\": \"command-r-plus\", \"created_at\": \"2025-11-17T21:16:07.962556502Z\", \"done\": true, \"done_reason\": \"stop\", \"total_duration\": 57849095846, \"load_duration\": 60705209, \"prompt_eval_count\": 7176, \"prompt_eval_duration\": 25191554155, \"eval_count\": 271, \"eval_duration\": 32586829607, \"model_name\": \"command-r-plus\"}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"id\": \"run--5fbfa237-9875-4b92-9e1d-3f11ec8f529b-0\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"name\": \"get_all_instances_of_entity_type\", \"args\": {\"parameters\": {\"reasoning\": \"To identify the root causes, I need to know all the instances of each entity type in the system to know what is possible.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e109341d-1601-4bd8-90f9-b63bb49fff97\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:42:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:42:47.000: `Background saving started by pid 1672` >>> 17:47:49.000: `Background saving started by pid 1673`\\n  - 2022-03-20 17:42:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 17:42:47.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"cffae581-3b00-490c-9094-15c7319a87cd\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 18:07:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 18:07:57.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 18:07:57.000: `Background saving started by pid 1677` >>> 18:12:59.000: `Background saving started by pid 1678`\\n  - 2022-03-20 18:07:57.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 18:07:57.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"3ffd518a-8faf-49fa-bd76-c31de11c527b\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- emailservice-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None.

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2863a174-0dcf-42c7-b086-1861b9b2e42d\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 19:08:25.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 19:08:25.000: `Background saving started by pid 1689` >>> 19:13:27.000: `Background saving started by pid 1690`\\n  - 2022-03-20 19:08:25.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 19:08:25.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b5f9415e-a4f5-422f-a742-6a00c22e89cc\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 19:38:37.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 19:38:37.000: `Background saving started by pid 1695` >>> 19:43:39.000: `Background saving started by pid 1696`\\n  - 2022-03-20 19:38:37.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 19:38:37.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

The node-3 CPU usage increased because the services running on it are using more CPU.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"90b8cead-c3e8-4876-bbb7-86f712937f24\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 20:27:00.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 20:27:00.000: `Background saving started by pid 1704`\\n  - 2022-03-20 20:27:00.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 20:27:00.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"37acd54b-15ed-4cd0-a9b8-703ced3945d3\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- emailservice-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7bd1d4a5-df8d-40ed-8f9f-81bf9497ec73\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 21:34:56.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 21:34:56.000: `Background saving started by pid 1715`\\n  - 2022-03-20 21:34:56.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 21:34:56.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

It is often expressed as a percentage and is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation \\u00b1 \\u2009 to the mean \\u03bc. The coefficient of variation is also known as unitized risk, or relative standard deviation (RSD), and is sometimes called \\u00abpercent\\u00bb risk when expressed as a percentage. It is often used to compare the degree of variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically different from one another. COV is also used in fields such as engineering or physics when doing dimensional analysis to derive a dimensionless quantity. The coefficient of variation should be computed only for the probability distribution of a non-negative variable (since otherwise the ratio may be negative), or to have a meaningful interpretation as a standard deviation of a proportion. A coefficient of variation may not have any meaning for data that are not on interval level measurement scale. For example, an ordinal variable such as \\u201clow, medium, high\\u201d may not have a meaningful 0 point, rendering the definition problematic. In most applications, a coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. This is sometimes referred to as a \\u201crelative\\u201d coefficient of variation. It is often expressed as a percentage by multiplying the value by 100. The coefficient of variation is widely used in analytical chemistry to present a normalized measure of dispersion of replicates of a measurement in a data set. Unlike the relative standard deviation, it is independent of the unit of measurement, and thus allows for comparison between series that use different measurement units. The coefficient of variation is sometimes described as the \\u201cnormalized\\u201d standard deviation. It is also sometimes called unitless risk, since it is a unitless number.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2b35d799-5f6f-4257-918b-b980f3c2f739\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 21:58:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 21:58:39.000: `Background saving started by pid 1719`\\n  - 2022-03-20 21:58:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 21:58:39.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"c28c1708-52ed-46aa-8487-d5bc9c04be45\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 22:06:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 22:08:09.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 22:08:09.000: `Background saving started by pid 1720`\\n  - 2022-03-20 22:08:09.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 22:08:09.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"93d6dda0-ddce-4cba-a083-7b3bff0efd9e\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 23:01:20.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 23:01:20.000: `Background saving started by pid 1726`\\n  - 2022-03-20 23:01:20.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 23:01:20.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"6bf4928f-0bf5-4860-91e5-9f868c595487\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- adservice:\\n  -

Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b0e0fb91-db68-46ee-a887-b1b433c172d5\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 00:46:07.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 00:46:07.000: `Background saving started by pid 1737`\\n  - 2022-03-21 00:46:07.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 00:46:07.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b4b78b67-ff48-457a-8540-d2815d2f9089\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:13:59.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:13:59.000: `Background saving started by pid 1740`\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:13:59.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:13:59.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"083cd6f7-c465-4402-a40f-7f58003244ba\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:23:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:23:39.000: `Background saving started by pid 1741`\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:23:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:23:39.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"9ef4cb76-f030-4c66-8ce5-37e4353ad6b7\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:51:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:51:39.000: `Background saving started by pid 1744`\\n  - 2022-03-21 01:51:39.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 01:51:39.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints).

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"fa7cea3d-aea8-4357-8ebc-67221214bfe9\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 02:28:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 02:28:47.000: `Background saving started by pid 1748`\\n  - 2022-03-21 02:28:47.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 02:28:47.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"05ba3e24-6454-4e2b-aef4-6523febe1b51\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-0 | container_memory_usage_MB | down\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:21.000 | LOG | frontend-0 | 03:11:21.000: `severity: error, message: request error` >>> 03:11:31.000: `severity: error, message: request error` >>> 03:12:45.000: `severity: error, message: request error` \\n\\n- frontend-2:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-2 | container_memory_usage_MB | down\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:31.000 | LOG | frontend-2 | 03:11:31.000: `severity: error, message: request error` \\n\\n- frontend-1:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:39.000 | LOG | frontend-1 | 03:11:39.000: `severity: error, message: request error` >>> 03:12:14.000: `severity: error, message: request error` >>> 03:12:27.000: `severity: error, message: request error` \\n\\n- checkoutservice-1:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:00.000 | METRIC | checkoutservice-1 | container_fs_reads./dev/vda | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:11:42.000 | LOG | checkoutservice-1 | 03:11:42.000: `022/03/20 19:11:42 Post \\\"http://jaeger-collector:14268/api/traces\\\": dial tcp: i/o timeout` >>> 03:12:12.000: `022/03/20 19:12:12 Post \\\"http://jaeger-collector:14268/api/traces\\\": dial tcp: i/o timeout` \\n\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:15:48.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 03:15:48.000: `Background saving started by pid 1753`\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:15:48.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 03:15:48.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a5606ca2-0973-43bb-9a02-d7eda6bacbf7\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:43:33.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 03:43:33.000: `Background saving started by pid 1756`\\n  - 2022-03-21 03:43:33.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 03:43:33.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"30f63ccf-8b40-48bd-a40b-7f2372818091\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 04:39:14.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 04:39:14.000: `Background saving started by pid 1762`\\n  - 2022-03-21 04:39:14.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 04:39:14.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"6c2dc1eb-b652-4465-ba4e-75f9581777c8\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 05:17:30.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 05:17:30.000: `Background saving started by pid 1766`\\n  - 2022-03-21 05:17:30.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 05:17:30.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"867c1e28-e26e-400c-ac54-74361a3962b3\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 05:36:14.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 05:36:14.000: `Background saving started by pid 1768` >>> 05:43:21.000: `Background saving started by pid 1769`\\n  - 2022-03-21 05:36:14.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 05:36:14.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"51a24b18-0ddc-482f-b4cd-1f957904897d\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 07:27:44.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 07:27:44.000: `Background saving started by pid 1785` >>> 07:33:59.000: `Background saving started by pid 1786`\\n  - 2022-03-21 07:27:44.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 07:27:44.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f8551b2a-3b57-4f6a-b536-104386dd4310\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 07:47:17.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 07:47:17.000: `Background saving started by pid 1788` >>> 07:53:34.000: `Background saving started by pid 1789`\\n  - 2022-03-21 07:47:17.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 07:47:17.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"3c13a5e5-287c-495f-8498-82233812f98e\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:00:31.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:00:31.000: `Background saving started by pid 1790`\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:00:31.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:00:31.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"96a8be50-eda6-487a-8f2c-876e64ff9e8c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:20:10.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:20:10.000: `Background saving started by pid 1793` >>> 08:27:00.000: `Background saving started by pid 1794`\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:20:10.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:20:10.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"851f8054-a2ee-458c-b63b-878e4d13e583\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:52:54.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:52:54.000: `Background saving started by pid 1798` >>> 08:59:10.000: `Background saving started by pid 1799`\\n  - 2022-03-21 08:52:54.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 08:52:54.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node.

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b36879ac-c9a7-4b1e-8c99-a9a9aed045f5\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 09:31:43.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:31:43.000: `Background saving started by pid 1804`\\n  - 2022-03-21 09:31:43.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:31:43.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2762e8b2-db70-41dc-a10d-53674ef55108\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 09:56:53.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:56:53.000: `Background saving started by pid 1809` >>> 10:01:55.000: `Background saving started by pid 1810`\\n  - 2022-03-21 09:56:53.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 09:56:53.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"9b75de02-9677-458c-ac03-5affac4987bc\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:16:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:17:01.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:17:01.000: `Background saving started by pid 1813` >>> 10:22:03.000: `Background saving started by pid 1814`\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:17:01.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:17:01.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"825c781c-82c0-4d09-ac92-f582d530526b\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:42:11.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:42:11.000: `Background saving started by pid 1818`\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:42:11.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:42:11.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a4e06b23-e999-4089-bffd-9241d1b853a0\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:47:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:47:13.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:47:13.000: `Background saving started by pid 1819` >>> 10:52:15.000: `Background saving started by pid 1820`\\n  - 2022-03-21 10:47:13.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 10:47:13.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Type: container network packet corruption\\nDescription: Network packet corruption is causing packet loss and high latency, which in turn is causing the high network receive throughput observed in the `redis-cart-0` and `redis-cart2-0` instances.\\nLocation: redis-cart-0\\nJustification: The `redis-cart-0` and `redis-cart2-0` instances are the only ones with a high network receive throughput. This might be caused by corruption of the packets as they traverse the network, resulting in retransmissions and ultimately the high throughput.\\nPropagation Path: node-1 --(hosts)--> redis-cart-0 --(instance_of)--> redis-cart\\n2. Type: container memory load\\nDescription: A memory load is causing high memory usage and low thread counts, which in turn is causing the high memory usage observed in the `adservice2-0` instance.\\nLocation: adservice2-0\\nJustification: The `adservice2-0` instance is the only one with a high memory usage and low thread count.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"d2f3806a-4af5-4a5a-a540-a728fd76f043\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 11:40:38.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 11:40:38.000: `Background saving started by pid 1829` >>> 11:45:40.000: `Background saving started by pid 1830`\\n  - 2022-03-21 11:40:38.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 11:40:38.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"939277ff-62d1-49df-9cd1-20c580d7d790\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 12:20:54.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:20:54.000: `Background saving started by pid 1837` >>> 12:27:36.000: `Background saving started by pid 1838`\\n  - 2022-03-21 12:20:54.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 12:20:54.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"99cb0d18-9706-4d5a-900b-4982730c7daf\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 13:42:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 13:43:07.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 13:43:07.000: `Background saving started by pid 1853`\\n  - 2022-03-21 13:43:07.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 13:43:07.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"43a26813-7801-482b-9952-3c31ce24c98c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 14:13:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 14:13:19.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:13:19.000: `Background saving started by pid 1859`\\n  - 2022-03-21 14:13:19.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:13:19.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"36ecfd89-ded3-4a92-ba24-8683b9ba8bc2\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 14:18:21.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:18:21.000: `Background saving started by pid 1860` >>> 14:23:26.000: `Background saving started by pid 1861`\\n  - 2022-03-21 14:18:21.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 14:18:21.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"cf6c9103-8102-44bf-a702-e13f6069def0\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:03:42.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 15:03:42.000: `Background saving started by pid 1869`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:03:42.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 15:03:42.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"d186eda8-7ceb-4111-8bec-5ee26b34f8fe\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- cartservice-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:43.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:43.000: `rying to start a grpc server at  0.0.0.0:7070`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:43.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:43.000: `eading cart service port from PORT environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:43.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:43.000: `nsecure mode!`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:43.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:43.000: `eading host address from LISTEN_ADDR environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:43.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:43.000: `tarted as process with id 1`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:44.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:44.000: `     Content root path: /app`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:44.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | `[40m\\u001b[32minfo\\u001b[39m\\u001b[22m\\u001b[49m: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]` (occurred 4 times from 15:08:44.000 to 15:08:44.000 approx every 0.000s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:44.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:44.000: `     Hosting environment: Production`\\n  - 2022-03-21 15:08:44.000 | LOG | cartservice-0 | 15:08:44.000: `     Application started.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2f1f63ce-3651-4b04-b3d7-c94bc4941caa\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"889653f2-6c45-42ee-870e-4fffe28cb87e\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:12:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:14:10.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 16:14:10.000: `Background saving started by pid 1883` >>> 16:19:12.000: `Background saving started by pid 1884`\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:14:10.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 16:14:10.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e742fe90-7140-448d-ae13-6b4ca2586d2f\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:44:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:44:22.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 16:44:22.000: `Background saving started by pid 1889` >>> 16:49:24.000: `Background saving started by pid 1890`\\n  - 2022-03-21 16:44:22.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 16:44:22.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Type: container memory load\\nDescription: This anomaly is likely to be affecting a container's memory usage, as evidenced by the `container_memory_usage_MB` alert. This may be caused by an increase in memory consumption, which in turn could be due to factors such as high CPU utilization or a memory leak.\\nLocation: adservice-0\\nJustification: This fault is likely to be the result of increased memory usage in the adservice-0 container. This is indicated by the `container_memory_usage_MB` alert, which shows an upward trend in memory consumption.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"5b3ba073-bc50-4901-9302-af2d43bf9c74\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 20:26:49.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 20:26:49.000: `Background saving started by pid 1932` >>> 20:32:29.000: `Background saving started by pid 1933`\\n  - 2022-03-21 20:26:49.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 20:26:49.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f3957156-96a1-49be-9eca-36f7731aa6c0\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- adservice:\\n  -

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"bb09eb0c-79e0-4c12-b332-49df30f9eca2\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- redis-cart-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 22:15:00.000 | METRIC | redis-cart-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 22:19:55.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 22:19:55.000: `Background saving started by pid 1944`\\n  - 2022-03-21 22:19:55.000 | LOG | redis-cart-0 | 22:19:55.000: `100 changes in 300 seconds.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately.

A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"bffc2c7d-ea1a-40cc-a45e-d87ecfe3bc6b\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- adservice-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7c8574b9-348a-4f06-a58a-9ddd33ff9eb5\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- adservice:\\n  -

latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":
