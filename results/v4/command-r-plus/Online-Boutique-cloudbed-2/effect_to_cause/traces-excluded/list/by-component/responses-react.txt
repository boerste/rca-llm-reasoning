Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"abf64383-e5be-43d8-8c41-2e9499f3d396\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:35:08.000 | LOG | frontend-2 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 67 times from 08:35:08.000 to 08:44:05.000 approx every 8.136s, representative shown) \\n\\n- adservice-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:35:08.000 | LOG | adservice-0 | `EVERE: Exception while executing runnable io.grpc.internal.ServerImpl$JumpToApplicationThreadServerStreamListener$1HalfClosed@7ffb0575` (occurred 158 times from 08:35:08.000 to 08:44:05.000 approx every 3.420s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:35:08.000 | LOG | adservice-0 | `ava.lang.NullPointerException` (occurred 158 times from 08:35:08.000 to 08:44:05.000 approx every 3.420s, representative shown) \\n\\n- frontend-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:35:13.000 | LOG | frontend-0 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 69 times from 08:35:13.000 to 08:44:03.000 approx every 7.794s, representative shown) \\n\\n- frontend-1:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:35:36.000 | LOG | frontend-1 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 22 times from 08:35:36.000 to 08:44:05.000 approx every 24.238s, representative shown) \\n\\n- cartservice-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-0 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | down \\n\\n- cartservice-2:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-2 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | down \\n\\n- node-6:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | node-6 | system.io.w_s | up \\n\\n- paymentservice-2:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | paymentservice-2 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up \\n\\n- productcatalogservice2-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | productcatalogservice2-0 | container_fs_reads./dev/vda | up \\n\\n- recommendationservice:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice | grpc-mrt | up \\n\\n- recommendationservice-1:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice-1 | container_memory_usage_MB | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:44:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice-1 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up \\n\\n- recommendationservice2-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice2-0 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice2-0 | container_fs_reads./dev/vda | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice2-0 | container_fs_writes./dev/vda | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice2-0 | container_memory_usage_MB | up\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice2-0 | container_threads | up \\n\\n- shippingservice2-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:36:00.000 | METRIC | shippingservice2-0 | container_memory_usage_MB | up \\n\\n- cartservice-1:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:37:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-1 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | down \\n\\n- node-3:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:38:00.000 | METRIC | node-3 | system.io.w_s | up \\n\\n- recommendationservice-0:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:39:00.000 | METRIC | recommendationservice-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up \\n\\n- adservice:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:40:00.000 | METRIC | adservice | grpc-mrt | up \\n\\n- shippingservice-2:\\n  - 2022-03-20 08:41:00.000 | METRIC | shippingservice-2 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up \\n\\n\\n\\nNo trace alerts were detected.\\nThink step by step and ensure your reasoning is traceable through the knowledge graph.\\n\\n### CLARIFICATIONS:\\n- **Alert Coverage**: The alerts represent the *full* set of detected anomalies.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e34cfa47-64ad-4f84-afd9-4c29d2c42ab2\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"301bee33-e18d-4576-8974-8ba8f3b4913a\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"43ffd426-84db-48a4-b4d5-60228ca39664\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"66af849e-6253-4931-bc86-2be6e5dc7a67\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"67b126e1-fdd3-44e6-a46b-008d434399aa\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"3cca1ba6-b3d1-48f6-970a-03fb456bd754\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"3257bab1-2e1d-4287-9e7c-aa7989db28a9\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"8d6d931b-700a-4d09-b405-d5cfa673fbbe\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"bacefcf1-5809-40aa-932e-6c64d7a4a09c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"66ef3936-b3c7-4eb7-86e3-4d1da72ad2af\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"417bf91d-1efb-4344-890b-4384d4a5e59b\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"63dcd91f-001a-4142-8f32-a21921aa46c4\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"4e258564-d3f5-4950-9097-1695a233f3ea\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e0766ab7-4b69-48d6-98bc-43dc14b95785\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"563ebe51-fef2-45a4-8b3d-bc6b04fbbfcd\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a9813e91-8331-451b-bbee-9c68a3df042e\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"88a403a2-495a-436b-9683-b5a96dde50f1\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"53c01a48-e087-414b-81d2-c84835205d8c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b8c83bdf-c3e7-4982-a476-410ce592b04f\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"ca5098bd-8019-48de-8bb9-b838984996c9\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"9aedb491-7aca-461c-8046-4120d6cc8597\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a1c47505-8f8c-4016-bc6f-e61cf46f97e9\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"fe84f66e-53fa-4838-aa53-176db9ac9262\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"8f182b8a-dabe-4502-a4c2-75bfbe55a2f6\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"6950332a-2fc4-4fab-9b12-6ad888b3c750\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2b38d215-76a7-4ceb-a973-11e6a9a9a03a\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"0ce3d65a-e8dc-4d49-bd3e-251592bfcfe9\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"172c3871-3832-452b-ab6f-57241b1087be\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"b816b32f-9ad7-4aad-9f64-138736bfcc25\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7f287f19-b419-4770-8812-7a032a3c68ec\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a88faf24-7591-4186-9f03-38ba69511468\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"4adc5d77-37a4-4a46-8b0b-703669d1a6bd\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"15a3e177-8161-4cec-b244-121fcf4bc754\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2d096189-ffc4-474c-8205-904fe5d733d2\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"bd3408b8-535f-4db5-b215-5335a5ccd6e2\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"c0c80b69-cf20-40bd-87e0-49781bc771e7\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"82d1680b-7fa8-4fea-8205-481a38be57ab\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f67c8e16-fa94-4615-b2f0-ef42a84914b1\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"65ff3378-a6e0-47a7-ada3-7c6d5d858b83\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f97c7510-ade2-4d2b-becc-392b55eee6da\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- productcatalogservice-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"5693ec81-f353-42c4-90e1-118fa190f71c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f2719d02-83b7-4766-893d-23f42a448a93\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"c9e8f9d9-3695-4aae-9eab-92fabb46a38f\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"af7e5d07-d0e3-4116-b53c-603c44461cbc\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"09961a2a-3965-4c5f-b6a0-a8978ced2106\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"e977ef9d-20dc-4eca-ade4-2fdfa6fafcd7\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"6661d43b-0357-4b71-9f38-f0ee57e93140\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a835f1f3-530b-4141-80f8-1fd35f385b25\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately.

A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"f5b66999-39f0-43ab-adb2-364c1977cd87\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"cd0631cd-4fa0-43cd-ac1d-c0eeb2f5797c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"1aaa111b-b357-4c6a-afef-38587bdc69e8\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"7bc18e72-9ff2-4944-b0ab-af745ae56519\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"54d7e3c3-aeb7-4c37-8b1b-337cd20e7cec\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"ea8051aa-d33f-48ea-ba7d-0d5cb646a91e\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"4c0ba32d-d1f9-4609-9289-41b3b8caeea4\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"9188b816-fb0b-402c-a832-b58cd05c4943\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"57d51dd3-4e9b-4861-a3c7-30c1c28941eb\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"82def2f9-a9c9-4e16-9268-def745e6f519\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"52588900-0e8a-4545-b733-ab1bee3245a4\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:44:54.000 | LOG | frontend-0 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 272 times from 18:44:54.000 to 18:53:51.000 approx every 1.982s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-0 | container_memory_usage_MB | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-0 | container_threads | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:46:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-0 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:49:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-0 | container_network_receive_packets.eth0 | up \\n\\n- adservice-0:\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:44:54.000 | LOG | adservice-0 | `EVERE: Exception while executing runnable io.grpc.internal.ServerImpl$JumpToApplicationThreadServerStreamListener$1HalfClosed@736f6f72` (occurred 577 times from 18:44:54.000 to 18:53:52.000 approx every 0.934s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:44:54.000 | LOG | adservice-0 | `ava.lang.NullPointerException` (occurred 577 times from 18:44:54.000 to 18:53:52.000 approx every 0.934s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | adservice-0 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | down\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | adservice-0 | container_memory_usage_MB | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:49:00.000 | METRIC | adservice-0 | container_threads | up \\n\\n- frontend-2:\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:44:55.000 | LOG | frontend-2 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 159 times from 18:44:55.000 to 18:53:51.000 approx every 3.392s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-2 | container_memory_usage_MB | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-2 | container_threads | up \\n\\n- frontend-1:\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:44:56.000 | LOG | frontend-1 | `severity: warning, message: failed to retrieve ads` (occurred 146 times from 18:44:56.000 to 18:53:52.000 approx every 3.697s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:45:00.000 | METRIC | frontend-1 | container_memory_usage_MB | up \\n\\n- cartservice-1:\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:47:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-1 | container_cpu_usage_seconds | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:47:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-1 | container_network_receive_MB.eth0 | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-1 | container_memory_usage_MB | down\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:00.000 | METRIC | cartservice-1 | container_threads | up\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:05.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:05.000: `ut of memory.`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:06.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:06.000: `nsecure mode!`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:06.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:06.000: `rying to start a grpc server at  0.0.0.0:7070`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:06.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:06.000: `eading cart service port from PORT environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:06.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:06.000: `eading host address from LISTEN_ADDR environment variable`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:06.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:06.000: `tarted as process with id 1`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:07.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | `[40m\\u001b[32minfo\\u001b[39m\\u001b[22m\\u001b[49m: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]` (occurred 4 times from 18:51:07.000 to 18:51:07.000 approx every 0.000s, representative shown)\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:07.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:07.000: `     Hosting environment: Production`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:07.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:07.000: `     Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7070`\\n  - 2022-03-21 18:51:07.000 | LOG | cartservice-1 | 18:51:07.000: `     Application started.

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"0f790b1c-e7c7-4d27-acfc-da9f8ff518ab\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"860d5d1e-6b55-42a2-9a09-00788cce4053\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"5ff1e65e-4807-4b9b-ad9d-c61bcdc5e1be\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"9d13bc7c-9d26-4aac-81d2-98f3cd2118f7\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"1dbd59aa-ca52-4865-9e67-2948c781d555\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"4d034746-4270-4fff-bd89-4833f3cf2d9c\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-2:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"2be4ebea-8607-45d8-8f81-ea851486752f\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-1:\\n  -

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"a9077102-781f-4daf-8059-e4603600ca16\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":

Errors or issues originating in one component may propagate to others due to dependencies, communication links, or shared resources. These errors often manifest as observable symptoms (e.g., anomalies or alerts) in different system components.\\n\\nThe system is represented by an explicit, typed, directed knowledge graph, where:\\n- Nodes represent system components or entities\\n- Edges indicate relationships between them\\n\\n## KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\\n### Entity Types\\n- Service_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Service. Examples: None. Attributes: type, log_alerts, metric_alerts.\\n- Cache: An organized non-persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: redis. Attributes: None.\\n- Database: An organized persistent collection of data and information that allows for its retrieval. Examples: MySQL, key-value store, file. Attributes: None.\\n- Service: An aggregation of software that satisfies an end use function. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n- Host: A virtual or physical computer, hardware device, or environment where software items or programs are deployed, installed, or executed. Examples: Virtual machine (VM), container, server, node. Attributes: None.\\n- Cache_Instance: A specific and identifiable runtime execution of a Cache. Examples: None. Attributes: None.\\n\\n### Relationship Types\\n- Cache --(has_instance)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Cache_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Cache_Instance --(instance_of)--> Cache\\n- Database --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Cache_Instance\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Database\\n- Host --(hosts)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service --(control_flow)--> Service\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Cache\\n- Service --(data_flow)--> Database\\n- Service --(has_instance)--> Service_Instance\\n- Service_Instance --(hosted_on)--> Host\\n- Service_Instance --(instance_of)--> Service\\n\\n**Note:** The schema defines *abstract* entity/relationship types and therefore only serves as a *guide*. The actual knowledge graph instantiates these as specific nodes and edges, which you can access exclusively through the provided tools. You have access to the following tools: `check_node_existence`, `get_node_attributes`, `get_edge_attributes`, `get_all_instances_of_entity_type`, `get_node_neighborhood`, `get_all_simple_paths`.\\n\\n## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nYou will be provided a set of observed symptoms/alerts detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component. Metric and trace alerts are reported based on the first observed anomalous value, not the full duration of the abnormal behavior. For example, if a metric remains abnormal for several seconds, only the initial timestamp is included.\\n\\n## TASK\\nUse the knowledge graph and the provided observed alerts/symptoms to identify the **three most likely root cause faults** that could explain the symptoms.\\n\\nEach fault:\\n- Must be localized to a single system component (node in the graph) of type `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- Must be restricted to the fault types listed in the INSTRUCTIONS section below\\n- Should include a plausible propagation path through the system that justifies how the fault led to the observed symptoms. There may be multiple plausible propagation paths. You may select the most likely or explanatory one, but must justify your choice clearly and refer to relationships in the knowledge graph.\\n- Must be well-justified using explicit reasoning through the graph\\n\\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\\nYou should think step-by-step in order to fulfill the objective. The step-by-step workflow should follow a \\\"Thought/Action/Observation\\\" loop that can repeat multiple times if needed. Here is how you should go about it:\\n1. **Thought:** reflect internally on the current task, the available information, and what to do next.\\n2. **Action:** if further information is needed, choose one appropriate tool to call. Any and all \\\"Thoughts\\\" must be included in the `reasoning` field in the tool input. Output only the tool call object and do not include any other text.\\n3. **Observation:** The tool will return a result, which will be provided to you.\\nRepeat this loop as needed until you have enough information to answer the original task.\\nWhen ready, output your final answer starting with the prefix \\\"Final Answer:\\\". \\n\\nRules: do NOT write \\\"Thought:\\\" or \\\"Action:\\\" separately. All reasoning must go inside the `reasoning` field of the tool input, only one tool can be called per step.\\n\\nYour \\\"Final Answer\\\" should consist of ALL THREE likely root cause faults.\\nFor each root cause fault, provide:\\n- **Type**: one of: \\n  1. container CPU load\\n  2. container memory load\\n  3. container network packet retransmission\\n  4. container network packet corruption\\n  5. container network latency\\n  6. container packet loss\\n  7. container process termination\\n  8. container read I/O load\\n  9. container write I/O load\\n  10. node CPU load\\n  11. node CPU spike\\n  12. node memory consumption\\n  13. node disk read I/O consumption\\n  14. node disk write I/O consumption\\n  15. node disk space consumption\\n Container-level faults (1-9) can occur at the `Service_Instance` or `Service` level. A fault at the `Service` level typically indicates that multiple, if not all, instances of that service are affected (e.g., due to shared configurations, dependencies, or systemic resource constraints). Node-level faults (10-15) occur only on `Host` entities.\\n- **Description**: an explanation of what the fault looks like in the system.\\n- **Location**: the *exact* node at which the fault occurs; must be of type: `Service_Instance`, `Service`, or `Host`\\n- **Justification**: a step-by-step reasoning based on the alerts and knowledge graph. Reference any relevant alerts.\\n- **Propagation Path**: a plausible propagation path in the knowledge graph that would make the root cause possible, formatted as `node1 --(edge_label1)--> node2 --(edge_label2)--> node3`, using only nodes and edge labels present in the knowledge graph.\\n\\nYour output should follow the field structure in the same order (Type, Description, Location, Justification, Propagation Path).\\n\\nRank faults in order of most likely to least likely.\", \"type\": \"system\", \"id\": \"0ece0b49-fa59-44ed-b08f-0e3e0897ccfd\"}}, {\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"constructor\", \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"messages\", \"HumanMessage\"], \"kwargs\": {\"content\": \"## OBSERVED SYMPTOMS\\nThe following symptoms/alerts were detected by an anomaly detector, ordered by component.\\n- frontend-0:\\n  -

Some system components may lack observability, so absence of alerts does not imply no involvement in fault propagation.\\n- **Alert Extraction**:\\n  - *Metric alerts*: Detected via 3-sigma rule\\n  - *Trace alerts*: Detected via isolation forest\\n  - *Log alerts*: Extracted using log templates (i.e., rule-based)\\n- **Log Alerts**: Preprocessed to prioritize errors and infrequent logs. Quantity does not always correlate with importance\\u2014-some critical issues may occur only once in the logs.\\n- **Trace Alerts**: \\n  - *PD* = Performance Degradation, indicating increased API latency and degraded system performance.\\n  - *400/500* = 400-level and 500-level error codes that occurred during the communication between two entities.\", \"type\": \"human\", \"id\":
